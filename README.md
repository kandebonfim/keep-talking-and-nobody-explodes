<strong>KTANE - The Great Interactive Manual</strong> is being developed on [Middleman StartaÃª](https://github.com/startae/middleman-startae).

### Installation

#### Basic installation

Start by installing [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/), if you don't already have it:

```
gem install bundler
```

Then just clone the repository down to your local machine:

```
git clone http://github.com/startae/middleman-startae.git my_new_project
```

Finally, do a ```bundle install``` to install the required gems -- even Middleman itself!

Use ```middleman``` to do your live development and ```middleman build``` to render your static file output to the ```/build/``` directory.
